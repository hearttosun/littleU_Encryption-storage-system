Based on the importance of documents, the U disk encryption and authentication system marks different sensitivity levels for files of the U disk, and through the GB SM4 block cipher algorithm to encrypt to ensure confidentiality. Using role-based access control (RBAC) model to manage permissions, and based on a credible administrator role to dynamically insert or delete roles, or grant permissions of different sensitivity levels files to the roles according to their requirements. By granting roles to users to dynamically control the user's permissions. And then through the SM3 cryptographic hashing algorithm to ensure the integrity of the system's information, to prevent attackers from illegally access or tamper.
After testing, the system can solve the U disk security issues effectively. And because the system in a multi-user environment is very suitable, it can also be applied to the data management of disks, cloud platforms and the big data, to solve the problem of the different sensitivity levels data sharing among multiple users.
